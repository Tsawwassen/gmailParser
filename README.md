## Weekend Project, Better emails sent
Send emails with CSS styles

## Goal
The first time I did sending emails, there was no style in the email, it was just a simple text. The goal of this weekend is to send an email with styles (headers, tables, lists)

## Plan of action
1. Test that the app is still sending emails
2. Add CSS to the email body so that the email recipient views the email with styles

## Post Weekend Project Comments


## Motivation
Improve the current function, so that I can combine CSV parser, and this email sender into one funcitonal app.

## Features
1. Send emails
2. Use CSS in the email body
